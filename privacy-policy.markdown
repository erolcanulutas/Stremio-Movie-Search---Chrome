# Privacy Policy for Stremio Movie Search

**Last Updated: May 07, 2025**

This Privacy Policy describes how the Stremio Movie Search extension ("Extension"), developed by Erol Can Ulutas, handles user data. The Extension is designed to enhance Google search results by adding a Stremio button next to IMDb links, with options to open content in the Stremio app or web interface.

## Data Collection

The Extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal or sensitive user data, including but not limited to names, email addresses, location data, web history, or user activity. No third-party services or analytics are integrated.

## Local Storage

The Extension uses the browser's local storage to save a single user preference (choice between Stremio app or web), which is stored locally on the user's device and not accessed or shared by the developer.

## Data Sharing

No user data is sold, shared, or transferred to third parties for any purpose, including advertising or credit evaluation.

## Security

All data handling is limited to local storage, and no transmission of user data occurs. The developer takes reasonable measures to ensure the Extension complies with applicable privacy standards.

## Changes to This Policy

The developer may update this Privacy Policy as needed. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. Users are encouraged to review this policy periodically.
